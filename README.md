# Face-detection-with-gender-and-age-prediction
This project is developed as a part of Elective course[Advanced Java] during 2023-2024. 
The proposed project aims to develop a robust system for facial detection and subsequent age and gender classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The utilization of CNN, a powerful deep learning algorithm, ensures the extraction of hierarchical features from facial images, enabling accurate and efficient face recognition along with age and gender estimation.

The key components of the project include:

Face Detection:
Implementing a CNN-based face detection model to locate and extract facial regions from input images or video frames. This initial stage forms the foundation for subsequent age and gender classification.

Data Preprocessing:
Employing preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of facial images, such as normalization, resizing, and grayscale conversion. This step is crucial for optimizing the performance of the subsequent CNN models.

Age and Gender Classification:
Developing a CNN architecture capable of learning discriminative features for age and gender prediction. The model will be trained on a diverse dataset containing labeled images with annotated age and gender information.

Model Training:
Training the CNN model on a comprehensive dataset, fine-tuning the model parameters to achieve optimal performance.

Evaluation Metrics:
Employing relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the face detection and age-gender classification models. Cross-validation techniques may also be applied to ensure robustness.

User Interface:
Designing a user-friendly interface to allow users to input images or utilize real-time video feeds for face detection and age-gender classification. The interface will provide visual feedback on the results, displaying detected faces along with predicted age and gender labels.

Optimization and Deployment:
Optimizing the trained models for efficient real-time performance and deploying the system for practical applications. Consideration will be given to hardware acceleration techniques, such as GPU utilization, to enhance processing speed.

The successful implementation of this project will result in a versatile and accurate system for face detection and age-gender classification, applicable in various domains including security, retail analytics, and human-computer interaction.
